The sizeof() is an operator that evaluates the size of data type, constants, variable. 
It is a compile-time operator as it returns the size of any variable or a constant at the compilation time. 
The size, which is calculated by the sizeof() operator, is the amount of RAM occupied in the computer. 
The size of pointers would remain same for all the data types. If the computer has 32bit operating system, then the size of the pointer would be 4 bytes. 
If the computer has 64-bit operating system, then the size of the pointer would be 8 bytes.
