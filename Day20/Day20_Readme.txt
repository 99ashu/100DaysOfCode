Struct Pointers:
A structure pointer is defined as the pointer which points to the address of the memory block that stores a structure known as the structure pointer.
Complex data structures like Linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. are created with the help of structure pointers. 
The structure pointer tells the address of a structure in memory by pointing the variable to the structure variable.
